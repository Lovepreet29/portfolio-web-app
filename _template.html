      <h2>What are Comics?</h2>
      <img src="img/comic.jpg" style="max-width:350px" alt="comic-main">
      <p>
        Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual information.
        It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons,
        captions, and
        onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. The size and arrangement of
        panels
        contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common image-making
        means in
        comics; fumetti is a form that uses photographic images. Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag
        cartoons,
        and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and tankōbon
        have
        become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century.</p>

        Retro or Vintage Comic Books
        Retro or vintage comic books are distinguishable by their bright covers, thin paper, common
        use of Ben-Dots and cartoony style. When comic books first became popular they were not only
        superhero comics; there are popular comics about Sabrina, Archie, crime, romance and more.
        The superhero comics are the ones that have aged well over the years and with every new generation of
        audience, the stories are appealing, the art captivating, and the length manageable enough for a quick and
        satisfying read.

            The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In order to
            capitalize on the growing
            popularity of comic books—especially those starring superheroes—Goodman created Timely Comics.

            Timely’s first comic book was
            Marvel Comics no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably
            the Human Torch and
            the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics’ “Golden Age” in the
            1940s, most importantly
            Captain America, who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1 (March 1941). Timely characters were
            often portrayed as
            fighting against the Nazis and the Japanese even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s
            came to a close,
            superheroes fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this
            genre in 1950. In 1951
            Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas Magazines. Though there was a
            brief experiment
            in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas’s output was mostly in other genres such
            as humour,
            westerns, horror, war, and science fiction.

          The Marvel Universe got its start almost exactly 60 years ago in 1961, and the origins of some Marvel
          characters (and the Marvel name) go back even further - 82 years to August 1939. In those decades since the
          ‘House of Ideas’ is responsible for hundreds if not thousands of timeless tales that have become part of
          the world’s modern mythology.</p>
